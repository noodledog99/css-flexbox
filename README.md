# Flex Box Basic
- Apply a display type of flex to the parent container
- The Flexible Box Layout Module, makes it easier to design flexible responsive layout structure without using float or positioning.

Note:
 - justify-content always work along the main axis and when we change the flex flow property for in column 2 Row 1 Row 2 column we're changing the main axis from across to down or from down to across and the justify content is always wordking on that main axis
 - __justify-content__ applies just to the __main axis__
 - __align-items__ applies just to the __cross axis__
 - flex-direction is mean "Main axis"
    - if flex-direction is __row__ then cross axis is __column__
